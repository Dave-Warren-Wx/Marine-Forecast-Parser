# Marine-Forecast-Parser
A Python script that scrapes and parses NOAA coastal waters forecasts into structured CSV data. In addition to seas, wind, seas, and nearshore conditions, it also returns a 1 if there is are any small craft caution or advisories in the text. Otherwise the 1 is for the "no alerts" situation.
